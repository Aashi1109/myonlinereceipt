    howToUse: [
      "Paste a fragment or a whole document. The preview re-renders as you type.",
      "The markup is rendered inside a fully sandboxed iframe: no scripts run, no forms submit, no navigation happens, and it has no access to this page or to your cookies and storage.",
      "Use it to eyeball a snippet from a CMS field, an email template, or a scraped page before trusting it.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The markup is not sanitised — it is contained, not cleaned. Do not treat a clean-looking preview as evidence that the HTML is safe to inject into your own page; your app almost certainly renders it with fewer restrictions than this iframe does.",
      "Because the sandbox blocks everything, scripted content will look wrong: `<script>`, inline event handlers, and anything that needs JavaScript simply do nothing.",
      "Remote resources — external stylesheets, images, fonts, iframes — may not load, so the preview can differ from a real page.",
      "The preview has no page styles of its own beyond the browser defaults, so a fragment that relies on your site's CSS will look unstyled.",
      "Email clients apply their own aggressive rewriting. A preview here is not a substitute for testing in the client you target.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Is it safe to preview HTML I do not trust?",
        a: "Previewing is safe: the iframe carries an empty `sandbox` attribute, which blocks scripts, forms, popups, navigation, and same-origin access. Copying that HTML into an application that renders it without those restrictions is not safe.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why does my JavaScript not run?",
        a: "By design. The sandbox has no `allow-scripts` token, so no script executes. That is what makes untrusted markup safe to look at.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does this strip dangerous tags?",
        a: "No. Your HTML comes back unchanged. If you need sanitised output, run it through a sanitiser such as DOMPurify on the server or in your own app.",
