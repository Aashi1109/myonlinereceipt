/**
 * Moved verbatim from the `html-viewer` case in
 * `lib/devtools/format-json.ts` (line 2713): the input is returned unchanged
 * with an html output kind, guarded only by the required-input check.
 *
 * CONTAINMENT — unchanged, and deliberately not widened. The source never
 * sanitised the markup; it relied on the renderer, which puts the value in
 * `<iframe sandbox="" srcDoc={…}>`. An empty `sandbox` attribute is the most
 * restrictive setting there is: no scripts, no forms, no popups, no
 * navigation, no same-origin access. The `render: "html"` branch of
 * `components/ResultView.tsx` uses exactly the same empty `sandbox=""` iframe
 * as the legacy `outputKind === "html"` branch in
 * `components/UtilityToolPrimitives.tsx`, so the containment is identical
 * before and after this migration.
 *
 * Adding a sanitiser here would be a behaviour change (it would silently
 * rewrite the user's markup, which is the one thing a viewer must not do);
 * removing the sandbox would be an XSS hole. Neither was done.
