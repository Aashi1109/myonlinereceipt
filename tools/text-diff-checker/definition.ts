    howToUse: [
      "Paste the original version in the first field and the changed version in the second.",
      "Compare. Lines are aligned with a longest-common-subsequence pass, so one edited line shows as a single removal plus a single addition instead of shifting everything below it.",
      "Read the markers: two leading spaces mean unchanged, a leading `-` means the line exists only in the original, a leading `+` means it exists only in the changed text.",
      "Copy or download the marked-up result to paste into a review comment or a ticket.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The comparison is line-based. A one-character edit is reported as the whole line being replaced; there is no word-level or character-level highlighting.",
      "Lines are matched exactly, including leading and trailing whitespace, so a re-indent registers as a change.",
      "The alignment is capped: the product of the two line counts must stay under four million — roughly 2,000 lines against 2,000 lines. Larger inputs are rejected rather than allowed to freeze the tab.",
      "The output is a readable marker format, not a unified diff with hunk headers, so it cannot be fed to `git apply`.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Does my text leave the browser?",
        a: "No. Both versions are compared locally in this tab and are never uploaded.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why is a moved block shown as a delete plus an add?",
        a: "The alignment finds the longest common subsequence, which has no way to express a move. A relocated block appears as a removal at the old position and an addition at the new one.",
      },
      {
        q: "Are CRLF and LF line endings treated the same?",
        a: "Yes. Both inputs are split on CR, LF, or CRLF, so a line-ending difference alone does not register as a change.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I use this output as a patch file?",
        a: "No. It is a review format, not a unified diff.",
      },
    ],

      {
        label: "One edited line",
