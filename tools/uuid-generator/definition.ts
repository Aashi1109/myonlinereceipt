    limitations: [
      "A UUID v7 embeds a Unix millisecond timestamp in its first six bytes, so it leaks roughly when it was created. Do not use v7 where that matters — use v4.",
      "Neither version is a secret. A UUID is an identifier, not a token: do not use one as a password-reset link, an API key, or a bearer credential.",
      "v7 values generated within the same millisecond are ordered only by their random tail, so they are time-ordered between milliseconds, not strictly monotonic within one.",
      "Uppercase output is not canonical — RFC 4122 requires lowercase on output, though readers must accept both.",
      "Removing the hyphens produces a 32-character string that most UUID parsers still accept, but some strict ones do not.",

      {

      {
        q: "Can two of these collide?",
        a: "Not in practice. A v4 has 122 random bits; you would need to generate about a billion per second for 85 years to reach a 50% chance of one collision.",
      },
