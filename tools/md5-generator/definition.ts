    howToUse: [
      "Paste the exact bytes you need a digest for. A trailing newline changes the result, so copy the value verbatim.",
      "Generate, then compare the 32-character lowercase hex digest with the one you were given.",
      "Use this for what MD5 is still good for: matching a checksum published by a legacy system, an ETag, or a cache key.",
      "For anything where an attacker could choose the input — passwords, signatures, integrity of downloaded files — use SHA-256 or HMAC instead.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "MD5 is cryptographically broken. Collisions can be produced on a laptop, so a matching digest does not prove two inputs are the same when an attacker controls either one.",
      "It is a plain digest, not a password hash. Never store passwords with it — use bcrypt, scrypt, or Argon2.",
      "Input is treated as UTF-8 text. Binary payloads and files cannot be hashed here.",
      "Output is always lowercase hex; there is no Base64 or uppercase option.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Is MD5 safe to use?",
        a: "Not as a security primitive. It remains fine as a non-adversarial checksum — verifying an accidental corruption, matching a legacy fingerprint, or building a cache key.",
      },
      {
        q: "What should I use instead?",
        a: "SHA-256 for a general digest, HMAC-SHA256 when a shared secret is involved, and bcrypt or Argon2 for passwords.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why does my digest not match?",
        a: "Almost always a byte difference in the input — a trailing newline, CRLF versus LF line endings, or a different text encoding.",
