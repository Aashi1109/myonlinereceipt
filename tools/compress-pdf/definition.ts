      "Turn on Remove document metadata to drop the producer, author, and XMP blocks as part of the same rewrite.",

    limitations: [
      "Preserve Document needs a cross-origin-isolated browser, because qpdf runs as WebAssembly over a SharedArrayBuffer. If that is unavailable the run fails outright — there is no silent fallback to a lossy mode.",
      "Strong Compression is destructive. Selectable text, links, forms, digital signatures, bookmarks, annotations, and accessibility information are all lost, and the pages become images.",
      "A file that is already well compressed may barely shrink, or grow slightly. Preserve Document never guarantees a smaller output.",
      "Structural jobs are capped at 500 pages, and the PDF must be 200 MiB or smaller.",

        q: "Why did Preserve Document fail with an availability error?",
        a: "qpdf needs SharedArrayBuffer, which the browser only exposes on a cross-origin-isolated page. Reload the tool, and if it still fails the browser or an extension is blocking isolation. Nothing is silently downgraded.",
