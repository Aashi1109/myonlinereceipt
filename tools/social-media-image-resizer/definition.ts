    limitations: [
      "Cover crops from the centre. There is no way to choose the crop point, so an off-centre subject may lose its head — use contain if the framing is tight.",
      "Small sources are enlarged to reach the target size and will look soft. Start from an image at least as large as the preset in both dimensions.",
      "Contain always pads with a solid colour; transparent padding is not offered even when the output is PNG.",
      "Platform requirements change. The presets cover the common sizes at the time of writing, not every placement each network supports.",

        q: "Can I make one image for several platforms at once?",
        a: "Not in a single run — each run uses one preset. Run the same files again with a different preset; the preset name in each filename keeps the outputs apart.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why does my image look stretched or soft?",
        a: "It is never stretched: the aspect ratio is always preserved. Softness means the source was smaller than the target and had to be enlarged, so supply a larger original.",
