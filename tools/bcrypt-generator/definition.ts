      "Enter the password or text to hash. It stays in this browser tab — it is never sent to a server or written to a log.",

    ],
    limitations: [
      "The cost range here (4–14) is chosen so hashing completes in a browser. Production systems normally use 12 or higher — benchmark on your own hardware and set it server-side.",
      "A fresh random salt is generated on every run, so hashing the same password twice gives two different hashes. That is correct bcrypt behaviour, not a bug.",
      "Bcrypt truncates input at 72 bytes. A longer passphrase is silently cut, and everything past byte 72 has no effect on the hash.",
      "This is for testing and fixtures. Never generate a real user's production credential in a browser tool.",

      {

      {
        q: "What do the leading characters mean?",
        a: "$2b$ is the bcrypt version, the next two digits are the cost, and the following 22 characters are the salt. The rest is the digest.",

      {
        q: "Which cost should I use?",
        a: "Whatever keeps a single hash around 250ms on your production hardware — commonly 12 or 13 today. The low values here exist so the tool stays usable in a browser.",
