    howToUse: [
      "Set the length. Length buys far more strength than exotic characters: 16 random characters is already beyond brute force.",
      "Toggle the character groups you need. Some systems reject symbols, so turn them off rather than fighting a rejected password.",
      "Generate a batch, pick one, and store it in a password manager. Values are produced with the Web Crypto API in this tab and are never sent anywhere.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Nothing is remembered. Reloading the page loses every generated value, so save the one you keep before navigating away.",
      "Each character is drawn independently, so a password is not guaranteed to contain every enabled group. Regenerate if a site demands one of each.",
      "The symbol set is a conservative ASCII selection; sites requiring characters outside it will need a manual edit.",
      "At least one character group must stay enabled.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Is this randomness good enough?",
        a: "Yes. It uses the platform CSPRNG through crypto.getRandomValues, with rejection sampling so no character is more likely than another.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does the password leave my browser?",
        a: "No. Generation is local and nothing is logged or transmitted.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long should a password be?",
        a: "16 characters for general use, 20 or more for anything protecting other credentials.",
