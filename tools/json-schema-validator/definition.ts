      "Validate. A pass returns a single line; a failure lists one problem per line, each prefixed with the JSON path that caused it.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "A useful subset of JSON Schema is supported: type (including integer), enum, required, properties, items, minLength, maxLength, and pattern.",
      "Composition keywords ($ref, allOf, anyOf, oneOf, not), numeric bounds, and format assertions are not evaluated and are silently ignored.",
      "Because unsupported keywords are ignored, a \"Valid against schema\" result means \"nothing checked here failed\", not full draft compliance.",

      {
        q: "Which JSON Schema draft is this?",
        a: "None of them completely. It implements the structural keywords that most hand-written schemas actually use. For full draft 2020-12 conformance, run a dedicated validator in CI.",

      {
        q: "Why is a nested error path written like $.user.roles[0].name?",
