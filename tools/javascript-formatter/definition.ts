    howToUse: [
      "Paste minified or badly indented JavaScript — a one-line bundle chunk is the typical case.",
      "Format. Braces open a new two-space level, semicolons end a line, and runs of whitespace collapse to a single space.",
      "Use it to make an unfamiliar snippet readable enough to understand. For code you own, run Prettier or your editor's formatter instead — this is a reading aid, not a build step.",
      "String and template literals are tracked and left untouched, so a `;` or `{` inside a string does not trigger a line break.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "This is a character-level pass, not a parser. It has no idea what an expression is, so it cannot reflow long lines, align arguments, or normalize quotes.",
      "Regex literals are not recognised. A regular expression containing a brace or a quote character can confuse the string tracking and mangle the output.",
      "Comments are not treated specially — a `//` comment containing a brace will be reindented incorrectly.",
      "Line breaks are driven by `{`, `}`, and `;` only, so `if (a) b(); else c();` stays on one line and a `for(;;)` header is split across three.",
      "Unterminated strings are reported as an error rather than passed through.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Is this a replacement for Prettier?",
        a: "No. It has no parser and makes no formatting decisions beyond indentation. Use it to read someone else's minified code; use Prettier on your own.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why did my regex get mangled?",
        a: "Regex literals are not detected, so a `/.../ ` containing braces or quotes is misread as ordinary code. Reformat that section by hand.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does it change what the code does?",
        a: "It only inserts and removes whitespace, so ordinary code behaves identically. The regex and comment caveats above are the exceptions to check.",
      },
    ],

        label: "Minified function",
