    howToUse: [
      "Paste a single well-formed XML document with exactly one root element.",
      "Convert. Attributes become keys prefixed with @, element text becomes #text when the element also has children or attributes, and repeated sibling names become arrays.",
      "Copy the formatted JSON, or fix the reported error if the tags do not balance.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "This is a deliberately small parser, not a full XML processor. Namespaces are kept as literal prefixes, DTDs and entity declarations are skipped, and CDATA is not unwrapped.",
      "Whitespace-only text is trimmed away, so mixed content (text interleaved with child elements) loses its ordering.",
      "An element that appears once becomes an object; the same element appearing twice becomes an array. Consumers must handle both shapes.",
      "Numbers and booleans stay strings — XML has no types to infer them from.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why is my attribute prefixed with @?",
        a: "So an attribute named id cannot collide with a child element named id. The convention matches most XML-to-JSON mappings.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why did a single-element list become an object?",
        a: "There is no way to tell a one-item list from a single value in XML without a schema. Normalise with Array.isArray on the consuming side.",
      },
    ],

      {
        label: "Element with an attribute",
