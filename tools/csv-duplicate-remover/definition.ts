      "Paste the CSV. The first row is always kept as the header and is never treated as a duplicate.",
      "Set the delimiter to match your file, then remove duplicates.",
      "A row is a duplicate only when every field matches an earlier row exactly. The first occurrence is kept and the order of the surviving rows is unchanged.",
      "If duplicates survive, check for stray whitespace or differing case — run the CSV Formatter first to trim cells, then dedupe.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Matching is exact and case-sensitive across the whole row. `Ada` and ` ada ` are different rows.",
      "You cannot dedupe on a subset of columns — the comparison always uses every field.",
      "Every row must have the same field count as the header; a ragged file is rejected.",

      {
        q: "Can I dedupe by a single key column?",
        a: "Not here — the whole row is the key. Extract the columns you care about first if you need key-based deduplication.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is the header row ever removed?",
        a: "No. It is split off before deduplication and always written back first.",
