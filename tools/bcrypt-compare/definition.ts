    howToUse: [
      "Enter the plain password. It stays in this browser tab — it is never sent to a server or written to a log.",
      "Paste the stored bcrypt hash, including the $2b$ prefix and cost. The salt is inside the hash, so you do not supply it separately.",
      "Compare. The answer is Match or No match; the verification itself is bcrypt's own constant-time check, so no timing signal is leaked.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Only bcrypt hashes are understood ($2a$, $2b$, $2y$). Any other format is rejected as invalid.",
      "Verification costs the same work the hash was created with, so a high-cost hash takes noticeably longer in a browser.",
      "Bcrypt truncates at 72 bytes, so two long passphrases that share their first 72 bytes both verify against the same hash.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why can I not just compare two hash strings?",
        a: "Every bcrypt hash carries its own random salt, so hashing the same password twice yields different strings. Only a bcrypt comparison is meaningful.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is the comparison timing-safe?",
        a: "Yes. The check is delegated to bcrypt's own comparison, which does not exit early on the first differing byte.",
