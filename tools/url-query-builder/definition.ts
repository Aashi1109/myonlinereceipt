    howToUse: [
      "Put the absolute http or https base URL in the first field. Any query string already on it is kept.",
      "List the parameters in the second field, one `key=value` pair per line. Keys and values are trimmed and percent-encoded for you, so type them as plain text.",
      "Repeat a key on several lines to send it more than once — `tag=dev` and `tag=web` produce `tag=dev&tag=web`.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Rows are appended, never replaced. A key already present in the base URL will appear twice.",
      "The split is on the first `=` in the line, so a value may contain `=` but a key may not. A line with no `=`, or one starting with `=`, is rejected.",
      "Encoding follows `URLSearchParams`: a space becomes `+`, not `%20`. Both are valid in a query string, but a server that decodes the query as a path segment will read `+` literally.",
      "Blank lines are skipped. There is no comment syntax — every non-blank line must be a pair.",
      "Only http and https URLs are accepted.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why is my space encoded as `+` instead of `%20`?",
        a: "That is the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` rule that `URLSearchParams` follows, and it is correct for a query string. Only switch to `%20` if a specific consumer requires it.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I replace an existing parameter rather than add to it?",
        a: "Remove it from the base URL first. This tool only appends. The UTM Builder has an explicit replace mode if that is the shape you need.",
      },
      {
        q: "Are my values encoded safely?",
        a: "Yes. Ampersands, equals signs, and Unicode in a value are percent-encoded, so they cannot break out and create extra parameters.",
