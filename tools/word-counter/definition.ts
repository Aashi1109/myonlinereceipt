      "Paste or type the text. Every count updates as you type — there is nothing to submit.",
      "Adjust the three toggles to match the counting convention you are held to. Hyphenation is the one that most often explains a mismatch with another tool.",
      "Read `Characters` for limits that count code points (most CMS fields) and `Characters without spaces` for editorial limits.",
      "Reading time assumes 200 words per minute and always rounds up to at least one minute once there is any text.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Words are whitespace-delimited tokens. Languages that do not separate words with spaces — Chinese, Japanese, Thai — will not be counted meaningfully.",
      "Sentence detection is punctuation-based, so `Dr. Ada` and `3.5` each count as a sentence break.",
      "Paragraphs are runs of text separated by one or more blank lines. A single-spaced document is one paragraph.",
      "`Characters` counts Unicode code points, so an emoji built from several code points counts as more than one character. Byte length is a fourth number again.",

        a: "Words divided by 200, rounded up, with a floor of one minute. It is a rough estimate, not a measurement.",
