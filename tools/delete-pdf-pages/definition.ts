 * default must be non-empty (`"all"`, `"odd"`, `"even"`, or a non-empty list),

 * tool the correct starting state is "nothing selected", which only an empty
 * string can express. `run.worker.ts` parses it with `parsePageSelection`.

      "Select the pages to delete in the preview, or type them as ranges such as 1-3,5. Nothing is selected until you choose, so a mis-click cannot silently drop a page.",
      "Check the selection. Deletion is applied to the copy you download; the file you added is never modified.",
      "Delete and download. At least one page must remain, so a selection covering the whole document is rejected.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "At least one page must survive. A PDF with no pages is not a valid document, so an all-pages selection is refused.",
      "Deleting a page does not shrink the file proportionally: shared resources such as fonts and embedded images may still be referenced by the pages that remain.",
      "Bookmarks and internal links that pointed at a deleted page are left dangling.",
      "Structural jobs are capped at 500 pages, and the PDF must be 200 MiB or smaller.",
