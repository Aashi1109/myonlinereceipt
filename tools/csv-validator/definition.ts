    howToUse: [
      "Paste the CSV and pick the delimiter it actually uses — a semicolon file checked as comma-separated will look like one giant column.",
      "Validate. The check covers quoting, a non-empty unique header row, and a consistent field count on every row.",
      "A pass reports the column count and the number of data rows, which is a quick sanity check against what you expected to export.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Only structure is validated. Column types, value ranges, and required fields are not checked.",
      "The first row is always treated as the header. A headerless file will report its first data row as headers.",
      "Header uniqueness is compared after trimming, so \"name\" and \"name \" count as a duplicate.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "What counts as an invalid row?",
        a: "Any row whose field count differs from the header row, or an unterminated quoted field.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does it check for a trailing newline?",
        a: "No. A trailing newline is normal and does not create an extra empty row.",
