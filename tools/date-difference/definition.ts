    howToUse: [
      "Enter the start date and the end date. ISO 8601 is the safest format — include the Z or an offset so the answer does not depend on your machine's time zone.",
      "A bare number is read as a timestamp: values under 1e11 are treated as Unix seconds, larger ones as milliseconds.",
      "The result updates as you type, and shows the gap in both days and hours, each rounded to three decimals.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "An end date before the start date yields a negative result rather than an error, which is usually what you want but is easy to misread.",
      "Days are fixed 24-hour periods. Across a daylight-saving transition the calendar-day count and this figure disagree by an hour.",
      "Leap seconds do not exist in JavaScript time, so they are not counted.",
      "A date string without a time zone is interpreted by the browser, which is not always UTC. Prefer explicit offsets.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why do I get 2 days and not 2?",
        a: "Both figures are trimmed of trailing zeros, so a whole number is printed as a whole number. A partial gap shows up to three decimal places.",
      },
      {
        q: "Which formats are accepted?",
        a: "Anything the browser's Date parser understands, plus bare Unix seconds and milliseconds. ISO 8601 with an explicit offset is the only form that is unambiguous everywhere.",
