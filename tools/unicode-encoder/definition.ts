    howToUse: [
      "Paste text containing accents, symbols, or emoji.",
      "Encode. Printable ASCII passes through unchanged, so the result stays readable; only characters above U+007F are escaped.",
      "Characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane become `\\uXXXX`. Anything above U+FFFF — most emoji — becomes the ES6 `\\u{...}` form.",
      "Use this when a file, config, or protocol must be ASCII-only, or to make an invisible character visible while debugging.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The `\\u{...}` form for astral characters is ES6 JavaScript syntax. It is not valid in JSON, in older JavaScript, or in most other languages — those need a surrogate pair instead.",
      "ASCII control characters (tab, newline, carriage return) are below U+007F and so pass through as literal characters rather than being escaped.",
      "Escaping is unconditional above U+007F; there is no option to escape everything, or to escape only selected ranges.",
      "Output is lowercase hexadecimal with no option to change the case.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why do I get `\\u{1f44b}` instead of two `\\uXXXX` escapes?",
        a: "The character is above U+FFFF, so it is emitted as a single code point in the ES6 form rather than as a UTF-16 surrogate pair.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I paste this into JSON?",
        a: "Only the `\\uXXXX` escapes. JSON does not accept `\\u{...}` — convert those to a surrogate pair first.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why is my plain English text unchanged?",
        a: "Everything in it is ASCII, and ASCII is left alone by design so the result stays readable.",
