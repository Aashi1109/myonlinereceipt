    limitations: [
      "The digits must form complete bytes. An odd number of hex digits is rejected rather than padded.",
      "Only `0x` prefixes, whitespace, colons, underscores, and hyphens are stripped. Other decoration — commas, `\\x`, `%` — is not, and will be reported as invalid.",
      "Bytes are decoded strictly as UTF-8. A sequence that is not valid UTF-8 is rejected rather than shown with replacement characters, so this will not decode Latin-1 or arbitrary binary.",

        q: "Why does it say the input is not valid UTF-8?",
        a: "The digits parsed into bytes, but those bytes are not a legal UTF-8 sequence — often Latin-1 text, or a multi-byte character that was cut short.",
