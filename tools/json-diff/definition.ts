      "Compare, then read each line as a path. `~ $.user.name: \"a\" → \"b\"` says that one leaf changed and nothing else under it did.",

    limitations: [
      "Object keys are compared by name, so a reordered object shows no differences. Arrays are compared by index, so inserting one element at the front reports every later element as changed.",
      "The output is a path listing, not an RFC 6902 patch, and cannot be applied programmatically.",
      "Values are compared with `Object.is`, so `0` and `-0` differ while `NaN` matches `NaN`.",
