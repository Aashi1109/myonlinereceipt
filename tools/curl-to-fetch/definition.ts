    howToUse: [
      "Paste a curl command — the 'Copy as cURL' output from your browser's network panel works well.",
      "Convert. Choose a status check with JSON parsing or keep the raw response, using top-level await or an async wrapper.",
      "Read the generated code before running it. If the original command carried a credential in a header or via `-u`, that credential is now sitting in your source — move it to an environment variable.",
      "JSON handling assumes a JSON response. Keep the raw response when you need text, blobs, streaming, or custom error policy.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "A practical subset of curl is supported: `-X`/`--request`, `-H`/`--header`, `-d`/`--data`/`--data-raw`/`--data-binary`, and `-u`/`--user`. Every other flag is ignored silently — including `-F` (multipart), `--compressed`, `-k`, `-o`, and cookie flags.",
      "The URL must be absolute and http or https. A relative path or another scheme is rejected.",
      "`-u user:pass` becomes a Base64 `Authorization: Basic` header, which is encoding, not encryption — the credential is plainly readable in the generated code.",
      "Multiple `-d` flags are not concatenated the way curl concatenates them; only the last one survives.",
      "`credentials`, `mode`, and `redirect` are not set, so fetch's defaults apply. Cross-origin behaviour may differ from curl's.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why did my `-F` upload disappear?",
        a: "Multipart form flags are not supported. Build a `FormData` object by hand and pass it as the body.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why did the method become POST when I never asked for it?",
        a: "That is curl's own rule: supplying a body with `-d` implies POST unless `-X` says otherwise. The conversion keeps that behaviour.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is it safe to paste a command containing my API key?",
        a: "The conversion runs entirely in this browser tab and nothing is uploaded. The key does end up in the generated snippet, so do not commit that snippet as-is.",
