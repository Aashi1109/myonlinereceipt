    howToUse: [
      "Paste a YAML document. Indentation is significant, so copy it verbatim rather than retyping it.",

    limitations: [
      "Only the first document of a multi-document stream (separated by ---) is converted.",
      "YAML anchors and aliases are expanded, so shared structure becomes duplicated JSON.",
      "YAML types with no JSON equivalent — dates, binary, custom tags — are not representable and will either stringify or fail.",
    ],

      {
        q: "Why does my YAML fail to parse?",
        a: "Almost always indentation: tabs are not valid YAML indentation, and a single misaligned key breaks the block. The error message names the line.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is my YAML uploaded anywhere?",
        a: "No. The conversion runs entirely in this browser tab.",
