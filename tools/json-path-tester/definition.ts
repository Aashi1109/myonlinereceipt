    howToUse: [
      "Paste the document you want to query, then write the path starting from `$` — the root.",
      "Step into objects with `.key` or `['key']`, into arrays with `[0]`, and fan out across every child with `*`.",
      "Evaluate. A path that matches one value returns that value; a path that matches several returns them as an array.",
      "Build the path one segment at a time when a query returns nothing — the error tells you the path did not match, not which segment failed.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "This is a practical subset of JSONPath, not the full grammar: recursive descent (`..`), filter expressions (`?()`), slices (`[1:3]`), and unions (`[0,2]`) are all rejected as unsupported syntax.",
      "A path that matches nothing is an error rather than an empty result.",
      "A single match and a one-element multi-match are indistinguishable in the output — both print the bare value.",
      "Key names inside `.key` segments are limited to word characters, `$`, and `-`. Anything else must use the `['key']` form.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why does my `$..author` path fail?",
        a: "Recursive descent is not supported. Walk the levels explicitly, or use `*` to fan out one level at a time.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I select every element of an array?",
        a: "Use `[*]`, for example `$.store.book[*].title`.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why is 'did not match any value' an error?",
