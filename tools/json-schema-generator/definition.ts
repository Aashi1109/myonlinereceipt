    howToUse: [
      "Paste one representative JSON document — the schema is inferred from exactly what you give it, so include the optional fields you care about.",
      "Generate, then read the result as a starting point rather than a finished contract.",
      "Loosen it by hand: every key lands in `required` and every object gets `additionalProperties: false`, which is stricter than most real APIs want.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The schema describes one sample. Fields absent from that sample cannot be inferred, and fields present in it are always marked required.",
      "No `$schema`, `title`, `description`, `format`, or constraint keywords (minLength, pattern, enum) are emitted — types and structure only.",
      "Arrays are summarised by the union of their element schemas: a homogeneous array gets a single `items` schema, a mixed one gets `items.anyOf`. An empty array yields `anyOf: []`, which matches nothing.",
      "Numbers are split into `integer` and `number` by the sampled value, so 10 infers `integer` even when the field can hold 10.5.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Which JSON Schema draft is this?",
        a: "The output uses keywords common to draft-07 and 2020-12 (type, properties, required, items, anyOf, additionalProperties). No `$schema` is declared, so add the draft your validator expects.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why is every field required?",
        a: "Optionality cannot be inferred from a single sample. Delete the keys that are genuinely optional from the `required` array.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I handle a field that can be null?",
