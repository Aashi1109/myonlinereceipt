    limitations: [
      "Character mode reverses by Unicode code point, so emoji and non-Latin scripts survive — but multi-code-point sequences such as a flag emoji or an accented letter written with a combining mark will come apart.",
      "Word mode trims the text and collapses every run of whitespace to a single space, so the original spacing is not preserved.",
      "Line mode joins with \\n, so CRLF input comes back LF-only.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why did my emoji break in character mode?",
        a: "Sequences built from several code points — skin-tone modifiers, flags, family emoji — are reversed element by element and lose their joiners. Use word or line mode if the text contains them.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I reverse lines without changing the words?",
        a: "Yes, that is exactly what Lines mode does: the last line becomes the first, and each line's contents are untouched.",
