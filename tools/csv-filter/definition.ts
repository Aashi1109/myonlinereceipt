      "Paste the CSV including its header row — the header is always kept, so the output stays loadable by the same tools that read the input.",
      "Pick the delimiter that matches the file. Comma is the default; European exports are usually semicolon-separated.",
      "Type the text to match. Matching is case-insensitive and matches anywhere inside a cell, not just at the start.",
      "Optionally restrict the search to one column by entering its header name or its 1-based position, then filter and copy or download the result.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Every row must have the same number of fields as the header. A ragged file is rejected rather than silently misaligned.",
      "Matching is a plain substring test — there is no regular-expression, numeric-comparison, or date-range mode.",
      "Only one filter term is supported per run. Chain runs to combine conditions.",
      "The whole file is parsed in memory in your browser, so very large exports are limited by the tab's available memory.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Is the header row ever removed?",
        a: "No. The header is always emitted first, even when no data row matches.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I filter on a column by position?",
        a: "Yes. Enter a number and it is read as a 1-based column index; anything else is matched against the header names.",
      },
      {
        q: "Are quoted values with embedded delimiters handled?",
        a: "Yes. Quoting is parsed properly on the way in and re-applied on the way out, so a value containing the delimiter survives the round trip.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why is an empty filter rejected?",
        a: "An empty filter matches everything, which is a no-op that usually means the field was left blank by mistake.",
