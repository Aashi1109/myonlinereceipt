    howToUse: [
      "Paste the five-field expression: minute, hour, day of month, month, weekday.",
      "Parse. Each field is range-checked and the result restates the schedule in words — the quickest way to catch a field written in the wrong position.",
      "An out-of-range or unsupported field names the field that failed, so you know which of the five to fix.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Five fields only. A leading seconds field (Quartz, some job runners) or a trailing year field is rejected.",
      "Supported syntax is *, */step, single numbers, ranges, and comma-separated lists. Named months and weekdays (JAN, MON), step-on-range (1-30/2), and the L, W, #, and ? specifiers are not accepted.",
      "Weekday accepts 0–7 with both 0 and 7 meaning Sunday.",
      "Day-of-month and weekday are validated independently; the OR relationship between them when both are restricted is not spelled out in the description.",
      "No next-run times are computed here, and no timezone is applied.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why was my expression rejected?",
        a: "Either it did not have exactly five whitespace-separated fields, or a field used syntax outside *, */step, numbers, ranges, and lists.",
