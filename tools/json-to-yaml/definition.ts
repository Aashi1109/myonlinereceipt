      "Paste the JSON document you want as YAML. Conversion runs locally.",
      "Leave auto-fix on if the JSON was copied from a log or truncated response; turn it off when you need the input validated strictly.",
      "Copy the YAML into your config file. Key order is preserved exactly as it appeared in the JSON.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Anchors and aliases are not emitted — repeated structures are written out in full.",
      "Only JSON's value types round-trip: dates, comments, and multi-document YAML have no JSON source to come from.",
      "Very deep or very large documents produce long output; YAML's indentation grows with nesting depth.",
    ],

      {
        q: "Is key order preserved?",
        a: "Yes. Keys are emitted in the order the JSON declared them rather than sorted.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I convert YAML back to JSON?",
