    howToUse: [
      "Paste comma-separated rows, quotes and all. Quoted fields containing commas are parsed correctly and unquoted on the way out.",
      "Convert. Fields are re-joined with tab characters, and only fields that still need quoting keep their quotes.",
      "Paste the TSV straight into a spreadsheet — tab-separated text pastes into cells without an import dialog.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The input delimiter is fixed at a comma. Semicolon- or pipe-delimited data needs a delimiter converter first.",
      "Every row must have the same number of fields; a ragged row is rejected rather than padded.",
      "A field containing a literal tab or newline is re-quoted, which some naive TSV readers do not handle.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "What happens to a value like \"Hello, world\"?",
        a: "The comma was only significant to CSV, so the quotes are dropped and the value becomes a plain tab-delimited field.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is the header row treated specially?",
        a: "No. Row one is converted like every other row, which is what you want when pasting into a spreadsheet.",
