    howToUse: [
      "Paste an ISO 8601 string, a date the browser can parse, or a bare Unix timestamp. Values under 100000000000 are read as seconds; anything larger is read as milliseconds.",
      "All four forms appear at once: ISO 8601 for APIs and logs, RFC 1123 UTC for HTTP headers, a human-readable local form, and the Unix epoch in seconds.",
      "Use the ISO line when you need an unambiguous value to store or send — it always carries the UTC offset.",
      "Include an explicit offset in your input (`+05:30`, `Z`) whenever you can. Without one, the browser assumes local time and the answer depends on the machine.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The `Local` line is formatted with the `en-US` locale so the output is stable across machines; it is not localised to your own regional format.",
      "The `Local` line still reflects your machine's time zone, so two people in different zones see different local values for the same instant.",
      "Parsing of non-ISO strings is delegated to the browser and is not standardised. `03/04/2026` is read as March 4 in some engines and April 3 in others — use ISO to avoid the ambiguity.",
      "Unix output is truncated to whole seconds, so sub-second precision is lost.",
      "Leap seconds are not represented, and years outside roughly ±275,760 from 1970 cannot be represented at all.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Is my timestamp in seconds or milliseconds?",
        a: "A bare number below 100,000,000,000 is treated as seconds and anything above as milliseconds. Ten-digit values are seconds; thirteen-digit values are milliseconds.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why is the local time not in my country's format?",
        a: "The local line is deliberately pinned to `en-US` so the same input produces the same output on every machine. It is a stable rendering, not a localised one.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why did my date come out a day off?",
        a: "Almost always a missing offset. A date-only string like `2026-07-22` is parsed as UTC midnight, which is the previous day in the Americas.",
      },
