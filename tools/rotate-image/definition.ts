    limitations: [
      "Only quarter turns are available. Straightening a photograph by a few degrees needs resampling and cropping, which this tool does not do.",
      "The rotation is baked into the pixels, not written as an EXIF orientation tag, so it survives everywhere — but it also cannot be undone by clearing a tag.",
      "The whole run shares one angle. Images that each need a different turn have to be done in separate runs.",
      "Re-encoding to JPG or WebP loses a little detail each time, and all embedded metadata is dropped.",
      "Each image must be 25 MiB or smaller, up to 50 files per run, and no more than 100 megapixels once decoded.",

        q: "My photo already looked upright — why did rotating make it sideways?",
        a: "EXIF orientation is applied when the file is decoded, so the preview you saw was already corrected. The rotation you choose is then applied on top of that.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does rotating reduce quality?",
        a: "The turn itself is exact — pixels are moved, not resampled. Any loss comes only from re-encoding, so choose PNG or a high quality to keep it negligible.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why did the width and height swap?",
        a: "A 90° or 270° turn puts the long side where the short side was. Use 180° if the dimensions have to stay as they were.",
