    howToUse: [
      "Paste the CSV you want tidied. Set the delimiter first — it is used to read the input and to write the output.",
      "Format. Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from every cell, and quoting is re-applied only where it is actually needed.",
      "Compare the result with the original before replacing a source file — trimming is not always what you want for fixed-width or padded exports.",
      "Line endings are normalized to `\\n`.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Every row must have the same field count as the first row; a ragged file is rejected rather than padded.",
      "Whitespace inside a cell is preserved; only the leading and trailing whitespace of each cell is removed. That means a deliberately padded value loses its padding.",
      "Blank rows are dropped, and a UTF-8 BOM is not stripped.",
      "The delimiter is not changed — this normalizes quoting and spacing, it does not convert between formats.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why did quotes disappear from some fields?",
        a: "Quoting is re-applied only where the value actually needs it: when it contains the delimiter, a double quote, or a line break. Unnecessary quotes are dropped.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will this change my numbers or dates?",
        a: "No. Every cell is treated as text and is written back byte-for-byte apart from the trim.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does it fix a ragged file?",
        a: "No. Rows with the wrong field count are reported as an error so you can find the real problem.",
