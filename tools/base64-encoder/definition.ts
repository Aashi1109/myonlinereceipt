    howToUse: [
      "Paste the text to encode. It is treated as UTF-8, so emoji and non-Latin scripts encode correctly.",
      "Leave URL-safe off for standard Base64 (the RFC 4648 alphabet with = padding).",
      "Turn URL-safe on when the value goes in a URL path, a query string, or a JWT segment.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Text only. Binary files cannot be pasted here — encode those with a file-aware tool.",
      "Base64 is an encoding, not encryption. Anyone can decode the output; never use it to hide a secret.",

        q: "When do I need the URL-safe variant?",
