      "Comparison is case-insensitive, which is right for hex digests but wrong for anything where case is significant — Base64 signatures included.",

        q: "Why not just paste them into a diff?",
        a: "A naive comparison stops at the first differing character, and the time it takes leaks how much of a secret you guessed correctly. This comparison always scans both values in full.",

      {
        q: "Can I compare Base64 signatures here?",
