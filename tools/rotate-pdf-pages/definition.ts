      "Choose the pages to rotate. Leave it on all, or use odd, even, or ranges such as 1-3,5 when a scanner produced alternating orientations.",
      "Pick 90°, 180°, or 270°. Rotation is clockwise and is added to whatever rotation the page already has, so running 90° twice gives 180°.",
      "Rotate and download. Only the page rotation changes; the content itself is untouched.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Only quarter turns are supported, because a PDF page rotation is defined as a multiple of 90 degrees. Arbitrary angles are not possible.",
      "Rotation is relative, not absolute: it is added to the page's current rotation rather than replacing it. Two 270° runs leave a page at 180°.",
      "The page content and its box are unchanged — a viewer simply displays the page turned. Nothing is re-rendered and no quality is lost.",
      "Structural jobs are capped at 500 pages, and the PDF must be 200 MiB or smaller.",
      "Encrypted or password-protected PDFs are rejected, and rotating pages invalidates an existing digital signature.",

        q: "Is the rotation absolute or relative?",

        q: "How do I fix a scan where every other page is upside down?",

      },
      {
        q: "Does rotating reduce quality or change the file size?",
        a: "No. Only a page attribute is rewritten; text stays selectable and images keep their original data.",
