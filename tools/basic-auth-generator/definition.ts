    limitations: [
      "Base64 is an encoding, not encryption. Anyone who sees the header can recover the credentials, so Basic auth is only safe over HTTPS.",
      "A colon inside the username makes the header ambiguous — the server splits on the first colon, so everything after it becomes part of the password.",
      "Credentials are encoded as UTF-8. Servers that expect Latin-1 may reject non-ASCII characters.",

    faq: [
      {
        q: "Is the generated header safe to paste into a shared document?",
        a: "No. It is your password in a trivially reversible form. Treat the header exactly as you would treat the raw credential.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I leave the password empty?",
        a: "Yes. Token-style APIs often use the key as the username and an empty password; the encoded value still contains the trailing colon, which is what the server expects.",
