    howToUse: [
      "Paste one representative JSON response. The shape of that single sample is what the interfaces describe, so pick a record with every optional field populated.",
      "Leave auto-fix on if the sample came from a log or a JS object literal; switch it to strict when you want malformed input rejected instead of silently repaired.",
      "Generate, then copy the interfaces into your codebase. The root interface is named `Root` — rename it to something meaningful.",
      "Re-run with a second sample if any field can be null or missing, and widen the generated types by hand where the samples disagree.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Types are inferred from one sample only. A field that is `null` in the sample becomes `null`, not `string | null`, and a field absent from the sample does not appear at all.",
      "Arrays are typed as the union of their observed element types. An empty array becomes `unknown[]`.",
      "No optional (`?`) markers are emitted, because a single sample cannot show which keys are optional.",
      "Nested objects reuse the property name for the interface name, so two differently-shaped objects under the same key name will collide.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why are my fields not optional?",
        a: "One sample cannot distinguish 'always present' from 'present this time'. Add `?` by hand to any key the API may omit.",
      },
      {
        q: "Where did the root interface name come from?",
        a: "The root is always `Root`, and nested interfaces take their name from the property that holds them, converted to PascalCase.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does my JSON leave the browser?",
        a: "No. Inference runs entirely in this tab.",
