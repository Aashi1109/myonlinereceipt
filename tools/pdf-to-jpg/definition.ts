      "Each page becomes a flat image. Text is no longer selectable or searchable, and vector artwork becomes pixels at the chosen DPI.",
      "JPEG cannot store transparency, so every page is rendered on white. Use PDF to PNG if you need a transparent background.",
      "Raster conversion is capped at 200 pages per run, and a single rendered page may not exceed 100 megapixels — a large page at 300 DPI can hit that.",
      "Encrypted or password-protected PDFs are rejected; remove the password in your PDF reader first.",

      },
      {
        q: "Which DPI should I choose?",
        a: "150 DPI matches typical screen use and keeps files small. Choose 300 DPI only when the output is destined for print or will be zoomed into, since file size and memory use rise sharply.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I get the text back out afterwards?",
