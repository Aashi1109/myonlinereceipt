    howToUse: [
      "Paste the stylesheet. Comments are removed, runs of whitespace collapse, and the spaces around `{`, `}`, `:`, `;`, `,`, `>`, `+`, and `~` are dropped.",
      "Minify, then copy the result into a `<style>` block or a `.css` file.",
      "Test the minified stylesheet in a browser before shipping it — see the limitations for the constructs this pass gets wrong.",
      "For a production build pipeline, use cssnano or Lightning CSS. This is for a quick one-off shrink.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "This is a regex pass, not a CSS parser. Rule merging only combines adjacent flat rules with identical bodies, and colour normalization only shortens reducible HEX values.",
      "It does not respect strings or `url()` values, so a comment-like or delimiter-like sequence inside a quoted string or a data URI can be corrupted. Data URIs are the most common casualty.",
      "Preserved `/*! ... */` licence comments are stripped along with everything else.",
      "The final `;` before a `}` is removed, which is safe, but no other structural change is attempted.",
      "There is no source map output.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Will this break my stylesheet?",
        a: "Usually not, but it can if you have quoted strings or `url()` data URIs containing `/*`, `{`, or `;`. Diff the output and test in a browser.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does it preserve licence comments?",
        a: "No. `/*! ... */` is removed like any other comment, so re-add any required attribution by hand.",
      },
      {
        q: "How much smaller will it get?",
        a: "Whitespace and comments only — typically 10-30% on a hand-written stylesheet, and much less on one that was already compact.",
