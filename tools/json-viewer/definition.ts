    howToUse: [
      "Paste JSON on the left. It parses as you type, so a syntax error is reported with the line and column while you are still looking at it.",
      "Explore the tree on the right — expand and collapse branches to find the shape of a payload without scrolling through a wall of text.",
      "If the input will not parse, choose a repair strategy and run Repair & clean. Removing broken properties drops them; setting them to null keeps the key so the surrounding structure survives.",
      "Copy or download the cleaned JSON once the tree looks right.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Editable text is capped at 2,000,000 characters. JSON files up to 100 MiB open in read-only large-file mode for complete validation, beautifying, or minifying with a bounded preview and downloadable output.",
      "Parsing is strict JSON. Comments, trailing commas, and single-quoted strings are errors, though the repair pass can often recover from them.",
      "The tree preview uses JavaScript numbers, so integers beyond 2^53 and high-precision decimals may look rounded. Transform actions are blocked for those values; whole-document copy and download preserve the exact source.",
      "Repair is a best-effort structural fix, not a schema validator. Always compare the repaired output against the original before using it.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Is my JSON uploaded anywhere?",
        a: "No. Parsing, repair, and the tree all run in this browser tab. Nothing is sent to a server.",
      },
      {
        q: "Which repair strategy should I pick?",
        a: "Remove when a broken property is noise you can drop. Null when downstream code expects the key to exist and can handle a null.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why does the tree round my large number?",
        a: "The tree uses IEEE-754 doubles, but whole-document copy and download keep the exact source. Format, minify, and repair stay blocked when they could change the number.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does the tree preserve key order?",
        a: "Yes for ordinary string keys. Keys that look like array indices are reordered first, which is a JavaScript object rule rather than a choice made here.",
