    howToUse: [
      "Paste text containing HTML entities — usually a value that was escaped once too often on its way through a template or an API.",
      "Decode. The five XML named entities plus &nbsp; are recognised, as are numeric forms in decimal (&#8212;) and hex (&#x2014;).",
      "Anything the decoder does not recognise is left exactly as it was, so a literal &copy; passes through untouched rather than being guessed at.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Only amp, apos, gt, lt, nbsp, and quot are supported by name. The full HTML5 named-entity table (over 2,000 names) is not included.",
      "Unrecognised entities are passed through verbatim rather than raising an error, so a partial decode is silent.",
      "Decoded output is plain text. Rendering it as HTML re-introduces whatever markup it contained — that is the point of the escaping you just removed.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why was &copy; not decoded?",
        a: "Only the six most common names are supported. Use the numeric form &#169; instead.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is it safe to render the output?",
        a: "Treat it as untrusted. Decoding is the inverse of escaping, so anything you decode must be re-escaped before it goes back into a page.",
      },
