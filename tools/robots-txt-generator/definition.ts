      "List one path per line, each starting with `/`. Paths are relative to the site root — `/admin`, not `https://example.com/admin`.",
      "Switch on Allow all when you want an explicitly permissive file; your path list is then ignored and a bare `Disallow:` is emitted.",
      "Add your sitemap URL as an absolute http or https address. It is validated, so a typo is reported rather than silently written out.",
      "Download the file and place it at the site root — `https://yourdomain.com/robots.txt`. Anywhere else and no crawler will read it.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Only one user-agent group is produced. Additional crawler groups and wildcard patterns (`*`, `$`) must be added by hand.",
      "`Crawl-delay` is not part of the original specification. Google ignores it entirely; Bing and Yandex honour it.",
      "robots.txt controls crawling, not indexing. A blocked URL can still appear in search results if other pages link to it — use a `noindex` meta tag or an HTTP header to keep a page out of the index.",
      "It is a public file and a request, not an access control. Listing `/admin` tells everyone the path exists and does not stop anyone from visiting it. Never use it to hide something sensitive.",
      "Paths are written verbatim with no percent-encoding, so a path containing spaces or non-ASCII characters needs encoding first.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Does blocking a URL remove it from Google?",
        a: "No. Blocking prevents crawling, which can actually keep a URL in the index without a snippet. To remove a page, allow crawling and serve `noindex`.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I use this to protect a private page?",
        a: "No. robots.txt is publicly readable and purely advisory. Use authentication.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why does my crawl delay have no effect on Google?",
        a: "Googlebot ignores `Crawl-delay`. Set the crawl rate in Search Console instead.",
      },
      {
        q: "Where does the file go?",
        a: "At the root of the host: `https://yourdomain.com/robots.txt`. It does not apply to subdomains, which each need their own.",
