    howToUse: [
      "Copy a range straight out of a spreadsheet — the clipboard format is already tab-separated — and paste it here.",
      "Convert. Fields containing a comma, a quote, or a line break are quoted and their quotes doubled, so the CSV survives a round trip.",
      "Copy or download the result.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Every row must have the same number of fields. A ragged paste is rejected rather than silently padded.",
      "The output always uses a comma. Use the delimiter converter if you need semicolons for a locale that treats the comma as a decimal separator.",
      "No BOM is written. Some spreadsheet apps need one to detect UTF-8 — add it in your editor if accents come out wrong.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why was my input rejected?",
        a: "Rows had differing field counts. A tab inside a value, or a trailing tab on one line, is the usual cause.",
      },
      {
        q: "Are quotes handled?",
        a: "Yes. Values containing a comma, a double quote, or a newline are wrapped in quotes with inner quotes doubled.",
