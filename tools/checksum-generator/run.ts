/**
 * Moved verbatim from the `checksum-generator` case in
 * `lib/devtools/format-json.ts` (line 2585): the same three Web Crypto digests
 * in parallel, the same `md5` package, and the same label padding.
 *
 * The padding is knowingly inconsistent — "MD5    " and "SHA-1  " are 7
 * characters while "SHA-256 " and "SHA-512 " are 8, so the hex columns are off
 * by one. It is preserved rather than fixed: this migration is a move, the
 * defect is cosmetic, and correcting it would mean editing a captured fixture
 * for no functional gain. Alignment belongs to a `key-value` render, not to
 * spaces baked into a string.
