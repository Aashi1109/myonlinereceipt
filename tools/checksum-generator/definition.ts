    limitations: [
      "MD5 and SHA-1 are cryptographically broken and are provided only to verify against systems that still publish them. Use SHA-256 or SHA-512 for anything new.",
      "Input is UTF-8 text. Files are not supported, so these digests will not match a file checksum from `sha256sum` unless the file is exactly this text with no trailing newline.",
      "A checksum detects accidental corruption. It does not prove origin — anyone who can change the payload can also publish a matching digest. Use a signature or an HMAC for that.",
      "All four digests are computed on every run; there is no way to request just one.",
      "Output is always lowercase hex, never Base64.",

      {
        q: "Why does my SHA-256 not match `sha256sum file.txt`?",
        a: "Almost always a trailing newline. Most editors add one at the end of a file; pasting the visible content here omits it, and that changes the digest.",
      },
      {
        q: "Which one should I publish for a download?",
        a: "SHA-256. It is the current default everywhere, and SHA-512 is a reasonable alternative on 64-bit hardware.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is MD5 useless?",
        a: "For security, yes — collisions are trivial to construct. It is still fine as a non-adversarial change detector and for matching against legacy systems that only publish MD5.",
