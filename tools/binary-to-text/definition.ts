    howToUse: [
      "Paste the bytes as groups of exactly eight 0s and 1s, separated by whitespace: `01001000 01101001`.",
      "Any whitespace works as a separator, so bytes split across several lines decode fine.",
      "Decode to get the UTF-8 text those bytes represent. Text to Binary is the inverse.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Every group must be exactly eight bits. Nibbles, 16-bit words, and unseparated bit streams are rejected rather than guessed at.",
      "The separator must be whitespace — commas, hyphens, and `0b` prefixes are not accepted.",
      "The bytes are decoded strictly as UTF-8. An invalid byte sequence is rejected instead of producing replacement characters, so this will not decode Latin-1 or arbitrary binary.",
      "A multi-byte character spans several groups: `👋` is four bytes and so four groups, in order.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "My input has no spaces between the bytes. Can I still decode it?",
        a: "Not directly — the input must be whitespace-separated. Insert a space every eight characters first.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why does it say the input is not valid UTF-8?",
        a: "The groups parsed as bytes, but those bytes are not a legal UTF-8 sequence. A high byte such as `11100011` on its own, or an incomplete multi-byte character, will do it.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does it handle big-endian versus little-endian?",
        a: "Byte order does not apply: each group is one byte and the bytes are decoded in the order given.",
