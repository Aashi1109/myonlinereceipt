    howToUse: [
      "Paste the whole command, starting with `curl`. Quoting is parsed the way a shell would, so headers such as `-H 'Authorization: Bearer …'` come across intact.",
      "Convert to get a single `await axios(config)` call with the method, URL, headers, and body filled in.",
      "Check the result before running it: strip any credential that came along in a header, and confirm the method matches what you intended.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "A subset of flags is understood: `-X/--request`, `-H/--header`, `-d/--data/--data-raw/--data-binary`, and `-u/--user`. Anything else — `-F`, `--form`, `-b`, `--cookie`, `-k`, `--compressed`, `-o`, proxy and TLS flags — is silently ignored, not translated.",
      "As with curl, supplying a body promotes an unspecified method from GET to POST.",
      "A JSON body is parsed and embedded as an object; anything that is not valid JSON is passed through as a string. No `Content-Type` header is inferred either way.",
      "`-u user:pass` becomes a Base64 `Authorization: Basic` header, so the credential ends up in plain sight in the generated code. Replace it with an environment variable before committing.",
      "The URL must be absolute http or https. Repeated `-d` flags do not concatenate the way curl does — only the last one is used.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why is my `--form` upload missing?",
        a: "Multipart flags are not supported. Build a `FormData` object by hand and pass it as `data`.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need to set Content-Type for a JSON body?",
        a: "Axios sets `application/json` automatically when `data` is a plain object, which is what a parsed JSON body becomes here. Add the header explicitly if you send a string.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is my command sent anywhere?",
        a: "No. Parsing and code generation happen entirely in this browser tab, and no request is made.",

      {
        label: "GET with a bearer token",
