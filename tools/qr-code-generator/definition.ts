    howToUse: [
      "Paste the URL or text to encode. Include the scheme (https://) so scanners open the link instead of searching for it.",
      "Pick an error-correction level. M is a good default; use Q or H when the code will be printed small, on fabric, or over a logo.",
      "Set the export size and margin, then adjust the foreground and background colors if the code needs to match a brand.",
      "Generate, download the PNG (or the SVG artifact for print), and scan the final asset with a real phone before you ship it.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Everything runs in your browser — nothing is uploaded — so the content is limited to what a QR code can hold: roughly 2,900 alphanumeric characters at level L, and far fewer at level H.",
      "Keep strong contrast between foreground and background. Light-on-dark and low-contrast pairings are rejected by many scanners.",
      "A transparent background is only scannable over a light surface; the scanner still needs a light quiet zone.",
      "Dense content plus a small export size reduces scan reliability. Raise the size or shorten the URL rather than lowering the margin.",
      "The tool does not shorten URLs, add a logo overlay, or produce dynamic/trackable codes.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Do these QR codes expire or get tracked?",
        a: "No. The code is generated locally and encodes your content directly, so there is no redirect service, no expiry, and no analytics.",
      },
      {
        q: "Which error-correction level should I pick?",
        a: "L for a clean on-screen code with long content, M for general use, and Q or H for print, stickers, or anywhere the code may be scratched or partly covered.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why will my code not scan?",
        a: "Usually contrast, size, or margin. Use a dark foreground on a light background, keep the margin at 4 or more, and increase the export size for long content.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I get a vector file?",
        a: "Yes. Every run also produces an SVG artifact alongside the PNG, which is what you want for print.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I encode Wi-Fi credentials or a contact card?",
        a: "Yes — paste the formatted string, for example WIFI:T:WPA;S:MyNetwork;P:MyPassword;; or a full vCard block.",
