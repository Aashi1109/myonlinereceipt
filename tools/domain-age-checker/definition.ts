    howToUse: [
      "Enter a domain. A full URL works too — the hostname is extracted, lowercased, and a leading www. is dropped before the query.",
      "Run the check. The domain is looked up against the public RDAP bootstrap service, which forwards it to the registry responsible for that TLD.",
      "Read the returned JSON: the registration, expiration, and last-changed dates come straight from the registry, alongside its status codes and the delegated nameservers.",
      "Compare the registration date against the age you expected, and the expiration date against your renewal calendar — a lapsed expiry is the usual cause of a domain going dark.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "This calls a third-party service — the public RDAP bootstrap at rdap.org, which routes the lookup on to the registry for the domain's TLD. The domain you enter is sent to them, and availability, accuracy, and rate limits are theirs, not ours.",
      "RDAP coverage is not universal. Many ccTLDs publish no RDAP endpoint at all, and a lookup for one of those fails rather than falling back to legacy WHOIS.",
      "Registries redact contact details under privacy rules, so registrant names, emails, and phone numbers are usually absent. Dates, status codes, and nameservers are the reliable fields.",
      "Dates are reported exactly as the registry publishes them, including its own timezone convention. A registry that never populated an event simply returns nothing for it.",

    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why did my .co.uk (or other ccTLD) lookup fail?",
        a: "That registry likely publishes no RDAP endpoint. RDAP is mandatory for gTLDs such as .com and .net but optional for country-code TLDs, and this tool does not fall back to legacy WHOIS.",
      },
      {
        q: "Where are the registrant name and email?",
        a: "Redacted by the registry. Since GDPR, contact data is withheld from public RDAP responses for most domains, so the useful fields here are the dates, the status codes, and the nameservers.",
      },
      {
        q: "What does a status like clientTransferProhibited mean?",
        a: "It is a registry status code, usually a lock set by the registrar to prevent unauthorized transfers. It is normal on an active domain and is not an error.",
      },
      {
        q: "The registration date looks newer than I expected — was the domain re-registered?",
        a: "Possibly. A domain that expired and was dropped gets a fresh registration date when someone else picks it up, so the date reflects the current registration, not the first one ever made.",
