    howToUse: [
      "Type or paste your text — the counts update as you type, so there is nothing to press.",
      "Read 'Characters' for a UI or database limit expressed in characters, and 'UTF-8 bytes' for a limit expressed in bytes.",
      "The two differ for anything outside ASCII, which is exactly when a field silently overflows.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Characters are counted as Unicode code points, so an emoji outside the Basic Multilingual Plane counts as 1 here but as 2 in JavaScript's `.length` and in any UTF-16 length limit.",
      "A grapheme built from several code points — a flag, a skin-toned emoji, a base letter plus a combining accent — counts once per code point, not once per visible glyph.",
      "Words are whitespace-separated tokens after normalisation, so hyphenated compounds count as one word and `a - b` counts as three.",
      "Sentence and paragraph counts are not reported here; use the Word Counter for those.",
      "Line count is the number of lines including the last one, whether or not the text ends with a newline.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why is my character count lower than my database reports?",
        a: "Most likely a code-point versus UTF-16 difference. A character above U+FFFF (many emoji) is one code point but two UTF-16 units. Compare against 'UTF-8 bytes' if the limit is in bytes.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does whitespace count?",
        a: "'Characters' includes it; 'Characters without spaces' excludes every whitespace character, including tabs and newlines, not just spaces.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is my text sent anywhere?",
        a: "No. Counting happens entirely in this browser tab.",
