      "Put the files in the order you want them. The merged document follows the list from top to bottom, and each file contributes all of its pages.",

    limitations: [
      "At most 20 PDFs per merge, each 200 MiB or smaller, and 250 MiB across the whole selection.",
      "The merged result may not exceed 500 pages; the copy fails the moment the running page count passes that limit.",
      "Encrypted or password-protected PDFs are rejected. Remove the password in your PDF reader first.",
