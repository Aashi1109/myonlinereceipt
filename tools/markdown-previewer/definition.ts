      "Paste or type Markdown on the left. The preview re-renders as you stop typing — there is no button to press.",

      "Copy the generated HTML if you need to paste the rendered form into a CMS or an email template.",
      "Remember that the preview shows structure, not your target site's theme — headings and code blocks will be styled differently once published.",

    limitations: [
      "GitHub-flavoured Markdown is the default; CommonMark mode disables extensions such as tables and strikethrough.",
      "The preview is rendered in a sandbox, so scripts, forms, and remote content embedded in raw HTML do not execute.",
      "Relative links and relative image paths cannot resolve here; they will only work once the document is published at its real location.",

      {
        q: "Is my document uploaded anywhere?",

      {
        q: "Is raw HTML inside my Markdown rendered?",
        a: "It is rendered as markup, but inside a sandbox that blocks scripts and remote loads, so an embedded script tag does nothing.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why do my tables not look right?",
        a: "GitHub-flavoured tables need a header row and a separator row of dashes, and every row needs the same number of pipe-separated cells.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I export the HTML?",
