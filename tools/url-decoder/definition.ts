    howToUse: [
      "Paste the percent-encoded text — a whole URL, a single query parameter, or a redirect target pulled out of a log.",
      "Decode. %20 becomes a space, %3F a question mark, and multi-byte UTF-8 sequences such as %F0%9F%91%8B are reassembled into the original character.",
      "If the value was encoded twice, decode the output a second time.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "This is decodeURIComponent, so it decodes reserved characters too. Running it over a full URL will turn an encoded ? or & inside a parameter into a real delimiter.",
      "A + is left as a plus sign. Form-encoded bodies use + for a space and need that replaced first.",
      "An incomplete or invalid escape such as %zz or a trailing % is rejected rather than passed through.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why is my + still a plus?",
        a: "Percent-encoding and form encoding are different. application/x-www-form-urlencoded uses + for space; replace + with a space before decoding those.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why did decoding fail?",
        a: "The text contains a malformed escape — a % not followed by two hex digits, or a byte sequence that is not valid UTF-8.",
