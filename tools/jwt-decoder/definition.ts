    howToUse: [
      "Paste the full token — all three dot-separated parts. The trailing dot of an unsigned token is required too.",
      "Decode. You get the header, the payload, the raw signature segment, and a `timestamps` block that converts the numeric `iat`, `nbf`, and `exp` claims to ISO instants.",
      "Read `alg` in the header first. `none` means the token is unsigned and carries no authenticity guarantee at all.",
      "Decoding happens entirely in this browser tab — the token is never sent to a server. Even so, treat any token you paste as compromised and rotate it if it was a live credential.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The signature is decoded but never verified. This tool cannot tell you whether a token is authentic, only what it claims.",
      "Expiry is shown as a converted timestamp, not evaluated. An expired token decodes exactly like a valid one.",
      "Only compact-serialization JWS tokens are supported. Encrypted tokens (JWE, five parts) are rejected.",
      "The header and payload must both be Base64URL-encoded JSON objects; a token carrying a non-object payload is rejected.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Does this verify the token?",
        a: "No. Verification needs the issuer's key and must happen server-side. Use this to read claims while debugging, never to make a trust decision.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is my token uploaded?",
        a: "No. Base64 decoding runs locally in this tab. The token is not logged or stored.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why is the signature field empty?",
        a: "The token is unsigned — `alg` is `none` — so the third segment after the final dot is empty.",
      },
      {
        q: "What is the `timestamps` block?",
        a: "A convenience view: any of `iat`, `nbf`, and `exp` that is a number is shown as an ISO 8601 instant so you do not have to convert epoch seconds by hand.",
      },
