    howToUse: [
      "Paste the contents of a JSON string — the part between the quotes, without the surrounding quotes.",
      "Run the tool to turn `\\n`, `\\t`, `\\\"`, `\\\\`, and `\\uXXXX` back into the characters they stand for.",
      "This is the usual next step after pulling a stringified payload out of a log line or a database column.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Input is the string body only. Including the outer quotes makes them part of the value, and a stray unescaped quote is rejected as invalid string content.",
      "Only JSON escapes are understood: `\\b \\f \\n \\r \\t \\\" \\\\ \\/` and `\\uXXXX`. Sequences such as `\\x41` or `\\u{1F600}` are not JSON and are rejected.",
      "A lone surrogate (for example `\\uD83D` with no low half) decodes to an unpaired surrogate character, which may display as a replacement glyph.",
      "This is the inverse of JSON Escape; it does not parse the result as JSON.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "I get 'Escaped string is not valid JSON string content' — why?",
        a: "Most often an unescaped double quote or a trailing lone backslash in the input, or a backslash sequence JSON does not define. Escape the quote as `\\\"` and the backslash as `\\\\`.",
      },
      {
        q: "Should I include the wrapping quotes?",
        a: "No. Paste only what is inside them; the tool adds the quotes for you.",
      },
      {
        q: "My value is a stringified JSON object — what now?",
        a: "Unescape it here to recover the raw JSON text, then run that through JSON Formatter or JSON Validator.",
