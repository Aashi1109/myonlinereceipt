    howToUse: [
      "Start with a diagram type on the first line — `flowchart LR`, `sequenceDiagram`, `classDiagram`, `erDiagram`, `gantt` — because Mermaid decides everything else from it.",
      "Write the body underneath. The diagram re-renders as you pause typing, so a syntax error shows up on the line you just wrote rather than after a long edit.",
      "Adjust direction to fit the shape of your content: LR keeps a linear pipeline readable, TD suits a tree or a decision flow.",
      "Download the SVG when it looks right. It is vector, so it stays sharp in a README, a slide, or a printed design doc.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Rendering requires a browser — Mermaid measures text to lay the diagram out, so there is no server-side render and no static export outside a tab.",
      "Diagram source is capped at 200,000 characters. A diagram anywhere near that size is unreadable long before it is rejected.",
      "Mermaid runs in its strict security mode: raw HTML in node labels and click handlers are not executed.",
      "Themes, custom fonts, and CSS overrides are not exposed. The SVG carries its own inline styles, which you can edit after downloading it.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Is my diagram source uploaded?",
        a: "No. Mermaid runs in this browser tab and the source never leaves your machine.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why does my diagram fail with a parse error?",
        a: "Usually the first line: the diagram type and direction must come first. After that, the most common causes are unescaped punctuation in a label and inconsistent indentation in a sequence diagram.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I get a PNG instead of an SVG?",
        a: "Download the SVG and convert it. SVG is deliberately the output because it scales without going blurry.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I use a label containing brackets or quotes?",
        a: "Yes, but wrap it in double quotes — `A[\"a [bracketed] label\"]` — otherwise Mermaid reads the bracket as syntax.",
      },
