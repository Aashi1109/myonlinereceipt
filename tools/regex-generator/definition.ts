      "Generate, then paste the literal straight into your code — no further escaping is needed.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The patterns are unanchored. Add ^ and $ yourself if you are validating a whole string rather than searching within one.",
      "The email pattern is a pragmatic approximation, not RFC 5322. Every regex short of the full grammar rejects some valid addresses — send a confirmation mail instead of trusting a pattern.",
      "The URL pattern only recognises http and https, and will not match other schemes or bare hostnames.",
      "The UUID pattern accepts versions 1–8 with an RFC 4122 variant nibble, so it rejects the nil UUID and the max UUID.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why is the JavaScript output full of escaped slashes?",
        a: "Because a raw / would end the literal. The pattern is identical; only the delimiter is escaped for the target syntax.",
      },
      {
        q: "Should I validate emails with a regex?",
        a: "Only for a quick sanity check on shape. The single reliable validation is delivering a message to the address.",
      },
      {
        q: "What does the strong-password pattern enforce?",
        a: "Lookaheads requiring at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, and one non-alphanumeric character, with a minimum length of 12.",
