    howToUse: [
      "Type or paste the text. It is encoded as UTF-8 first, then each byte is written as eight bits.",
      "Encode. Bytes are separated by a single space and are always zero-padded to eight digits.",
      "Remember that one character is not one byte: ASCII characters take one byte, accented Latin usually two, and most emoji four.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "UTF-8 only. There is no option for UTF-16, Latin-1, or any other encoding.",
      "The separator is a fixed single space — there is no way to group by character, insert byte prefixes, or emit a continuous bit stream.",
      "Whitespace in the input is encoded like any other character, so a trailing newline becomes `00001010`.",
      "Output grows to roughly nine times the byte length of the input, so large inputs get unwieldy fast.",
    ],

      {
        q: "Why does one emoji produce four groups?",

      {
        q: "Can I change the separator or grouping?",
        a: "No. The format is a fixed space-separated list of eight-bit groups.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I go back to text?",
        a: "Use the Binary to Text tool, which reads the same space-separated eight-bit format.",
