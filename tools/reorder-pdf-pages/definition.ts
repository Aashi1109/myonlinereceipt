      "Add a single PDF. Page thumbnails are rendered in your browser so you can see what you are moving — nothing is uploaded.",
      "Drag the previews into the order you want, or use the keyboard controls to move a page up or down without a mouse.",
      "The order starts as the document's own, so you only need to move the pages that are wrong.",
      "Reorder and download. The output is a new PDF whose pages appear in the order you set.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The order must contain every page exactly once. This tool rearranges pages; it cannot drop or duplicate them — use Delete PDF Pages or Extract PDF Pages for that.",
      "Page content, links, and form fields move with their page, but a link that pointed at a page number rather than a named destination may end up pointing somewhere else.",
      "Structural jobs are capped at 500 pages, and the PDF must be 200 MiB or smaller.",
      "Encrypted or password-protected PDFs are rejected, and reordering invalidates an existing digital signature.",
      "One document at a time. To interleave two PDFs, merge them first and then reorder.",

    faq: [
      {
        q: "Can I delete or duplicate a page here?",
        a: "No. A reorder is a permutation, and the run is rejected unless every page appears exactly once. Delete PDF Pages and Extract PDF Pages cover the other cases.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is the document re-rendered?",
        a: "No. Pages are copied structurally, so text stays selectable and images keep their original quality.",

      {
        q: "Do bookmarks and links survive?",
