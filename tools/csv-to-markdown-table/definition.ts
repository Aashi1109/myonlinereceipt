    howToUse: [
      "Paste your rows, including the header row — the first row becomes the table header.",
      "Set the delimiter to match your data. Exporting from a spreadsheet as tab-separated and choosing Tab avoids most quoting problems.",
      "Convert and paste the result straight into a README, a pull request description, or any GitHub-flavoured Markdown document.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Every row must have the same number of fields as the header row; a ragged row is rejected rather than padded.",
      "The first row is always treated as the header. There is no headerless mode.",
      "Alignment is not configurable — the separator row is always `---`.",
      "Pipes and backslashes inside cells are escaped, and embedded newlines become `<br>`, which renders on GitHub but not in every Markdown flavour.",
      "Quoted fields are parsed per RFC 4180, so a comma inside `\"a,b\"` stays in one cell.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "My data has commas inside a field. Will it break?",
        a: "Not if the field is quoted (`\"Smith, Ada\"`). Quoted fields are parsed properly. Unquoted commas are genuinely field separators and will split the cell.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why does it say every row must have the same number of fields?",
        a: "A row with more or fewer fields than the header would silently misalign the table. Fix the ragged row, or add the missing empty fields, and run again.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I control column alignment?",
        a: "Not from this tool. Edit the `---` separator row afterwards to `:---`, `:---:`, or `---:`.",
