    howToUse: [
      "Set how many identifiers you need and how long each should be, then generate. You get one per line.",
      "Leave the size at 21 unless you have a reason to change it — that is the Nano ID default and is comparable to a UUID v4 in collision resistance.",
      "Shorten only when the ID is scoped to a small set (a short link within one account, say) and you have a uniqueness check behind it.",
      "Every character comes from the platform's cryptographically secure random source, so these are safe to use as unguessable identifiers.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The alphabet is fixed: `A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`, `_`, and `-`. It cannot be narrowed to avoid look-alike characters such as `l`, `1`, `I`, `O`, and `0`.",
      "Identifiers carry no timestamp and no ordering, so they do not sort chronologically and are not index-friendly the way ULIDs or UUID v7 are.",
      "Uniqueness is probabilistic, not guaranteed. Short sizes collide much sooner than you would expect — keep a unique constraint in the database.",
      "Generation is not deduplicated within a single run, so a very small size can produce a repeat in the same batch.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "How long should an ID be?",

      {
        q: "Is this random enough for security?",
        a: "Yes — it uses the Web Crypto random source with rejection sampling, so there is no modulo bias. Do not use it as a password or a signing key, though.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why `_` and `-` in the alphabet?",

      {
        q: "How does this compare to a UUID?",
