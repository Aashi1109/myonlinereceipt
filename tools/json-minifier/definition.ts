    howToUse: [
      "Paste the formatted JSON you want to shrink. Everything runs in this browser tab; nothing is uploaded.",
      "Leave auto-fix on 'Remove broken parts' to salvage a payload that was truncated mid-copy, or switch to 'Off (strict)' when you need the input rejected rather than repaired.",
      "Run the tool and copy the single-line result into your config, fixture, or request body.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Minifying re-serialises through JSON.parse, so comments, trailing commas, and any other JSON5 syntax are lost rather than preserved.",
      "Key order is preserved, but duplicate keys collapse to the last occurrence — that is JSON.parse behaviour, not a choice this tool makes.",
      "Numbers are re-emitted in JavaScript's shortest round-trip form, so 1.50 becomes 1.5 and integers beyond 2^53 lose precision.",
      "Input is capped at 2,000,000 characters.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "How much smaller will my payload get?",
        a: "Only the whitespace is removed. Pretty-printed JSON typically shrinks 15–30%; already-compact JSON barely changes. Gzip on the wire matters far more.",
      },
      {
        q: "What does auto-fix actually repair?",
        a: "Properties whose value is missing or unparseable. 'Remove broken parts' drops them, 'Set broken values to null' keeps the key with a null value, and 'Off (strict)' fails on anything JSON.parse rejects.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is minified JSON still valid JSON?",
        a: "Yes. Whitespace between tokens is insignificant in JSON, so the minified form parses to exactly the same value.",
