      "Paste the destination URL with its scheme. A bare domain is rejected — analytics links must be absolute.",
      "Fill in source, medium, and campaign. All three are required; the build fails rather than emitting a half-tagged link that reports as direct traffic.",
      "Add term or content only if you need them. Blank fields are omitted from the URL instead of being written as empty parameters.",
      "Choose lowercase normalization if your reports are being split by capitalisation, then build and copy the tagged URL.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Only the five standard UTM parameters are supported. Vendor-specific tags such as gclid or mc_cid must be added by hand.",
      "Values are URL-encoded but not otherwise validated — a typo in a source name produces a valid URL that reports under the wrong name.",
      "Trailing and leading whitespace is trimmed from each value; internal spaces are preserved and percent-encoded.",
      "The tool does not shorten the URL, check that the destination resolves, or verify that your analytics property is receiving the parameters.",

    faq: [
      {
        q: "What happens to a query string already on the URL?",
        a: "By default it is kept and the UTM parameters are merged in. Switch to Replace existing query to drop it first.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why are source, medium, and campaign mandatory?",
        a: "Most analytics tools discard a partially tagged link and attribute the visit to direct traffic, which is worse than no tag at all.",
      },
      {
        q: "Should I lowercase my values?",
        a: "Yes, if more than one person builds links. Analytics tools are case-sensitive, so Email and email become two separate rows in the same report.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does a UTM-tagged link expose anything private?",
