    howToUse: [
      "Paste the raw text exactly as it is — including newlines, tabs, and quotes.",
      "Escape. Quotes become `\\\"`, backslashes become `\\\\`, and newlines become `\\n`.",
      "Copy the result and paste it between the quotes of a JSON string value. The surrounding quotes are not included, so you add them yourself.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The output is the escaped body only, without the wrapping double quotes.",
      "Non-ASCII characters are left as literal UTF-8, not converted to `\\uXXXX` escapes. That is valid JSON, but some strict consumers prefer the escaped form.",
      "This escapes for JSON only. It is not sufficient to make a string safe for HTML, SQL, or a shell.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why are there no quotes around the result?",
        a: "So you can drop it straight into an existing string literal. Add `\"` on both sides if you need a complete JSON value.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I reverse this?",
        a: "Use a JSON unescape tool, or wrap the text in quotes and run it through `JSON.parse`.",
      },
      {
        q: "Are emoji and accented characters handled?",
        a: "Yes — they pass through as UTF-8, which is valid inside a JSON string.",
      },

      { label: "Quotes and a newline", text: 'He said "hello".\nNext line.' },
