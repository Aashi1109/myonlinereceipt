    limitations: [
      "Enlarging cannot add detail. The resampler interpolates, so an upscaled image is a smoother version of the original, not a sharper one.",
      "Contain fills the empty area with white. There is no transparent-padding option, so use cover or an exact aspect ratio if that matters.",
      "HEIC input is decoded but cannot be written back out; choosing the original format gives you JPG for those files.",
      "Metadata is dropped in the round trip. EXIF rotation is applied to the pixels first, so orientation survives even though the tag does not.",
