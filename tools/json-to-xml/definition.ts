    howToUse: [
      "Paste the JSON document you want as XML. The top-level value is wrapped in a `<root>` element.",
      "Convert, then check the element names: a JSON key that is not a legal XML name is emitted as `<item>` rather than failing.",
      "Copy the result, which is prefixed with an `<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>` declaration.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The mapping is one-way and lossy. Types disappear — 42, \"42\", and true all become the text `42` / `true` — so converting back gives you strings.",
      "Arrays repeat the parent element name rather than nesting a wrapper, so `{\"tag\":[1,2]}` becomes `<tag>1</tag><tag>2</tag>`.",
      "Nothing becomes an XML attribute; every JSON key becomes a child element.",
      "Keys that do not match `[A-Za-z_][\\w.-]*` are replaced with `item`, so `{\"1st\":\"x\"}` yields `<item>x</item>` and the original key is lost.",
      "Values are escaped as HTML entities (&, <, >, \", '), which is valid XML but escapes more than the XML minimum.",
    ],

      {
        q: "Can I choose the root element name?",
        a: "Not here — it is always `root`. Wrap your JSON in a single-key object such as `{\"order\":{…}}` and rename or unwrap the root afterwards.",
      },
      {
        q: "How is null represented?",
        a: "As a self-closing empty element, for example `<note/>`. There is no `xsi:nil` attribute.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is the output pretty-printed?",
        a: "No. The XML is emitted on one line after the declaration. Run it through an XML formatter if you need indentation.",
