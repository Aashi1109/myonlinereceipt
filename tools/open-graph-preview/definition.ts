      "Enter the title and description exactly as they will appear in your page's meta tags — not a summary of them. Most networks truncate the title around 60 characters and the description around 155.",

      "Point the image URL at an absolute image address. Leave it blank to see the layout with a placeholder while you decide on artwork.",

    limitations: [
      "This is a mockup rendered from what you typed. It does not fetch your page, so it cannot tell you whether the tags are actually deployed or whether a crawler can reach the image.",
      "Only the core og: tags are produced — title, description, url, site_name, and image. Twitter-specific tags, og:type, locale, and video tags are not generated.",
      "Every network styles its cards differently and changes them without notice, so treat the mockup as a proportion check rather than a pixel-accurate render.",
      "Cached previews are not cleared. After you change tags, a network will keep showing the old card until you re-scrape the URL with its own debugging tool.",

      {
        q: "Why does my card still show the old title after I fixed the tags?",

      {
        q: "Can the image be a relative path?",

        q: "Are my title and description sent anywhere?",
