      "Each page becomes a flat image. Text is no longer selectable or searchable, and vector artwork becomes pixels at the chosen DPI.",

      "Raster conversion is capped at 200 pages per run, and a single rendered page may not exceed 100 megapixels — a large page at 300 DPI can hit that.",
      "Encrypted or password-protected PDFs are rejected; remove the password in your PDF reader first.",

      {
        q: "Why did I get a ZIP instead of images?",
        a: "Any run that produces more than one page is packaged as a ZIP so the download stays a single file. Convert one page at a time if you want a bare PNG.",
      },
      {
        q: "PNG or JPG for my pages?",
