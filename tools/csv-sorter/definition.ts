      "Paste delimited data whose first row is a header. The header is never sorted — it stays on top.",
      "Name the sort column either by its header text (an exact, case-sensitive match) or by its one-based position.",
      "Choose ascending or descending, then sort. Comparison is natural: item2 sorts before item10, and case and accents are ignored.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The first row is always treated as a header. Headerless data loses its first row from the sort.",
      "Only one sort key is supported; there is no secondary tiebreak, though the sort is stable so the original order survives among equal keys.",
      "Numbers are compared by natural-language rules, not numerically — mixed formats such as 1e3 or 1,000 will not order the way arithmetic would.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why was my column not found?",
        a: "Header matching is exact and case-sensitive, and a stray leading space counts. Use the one-based column number if the header text is awkward.",
      },
      {
        q: "Does sorting change my data?",
        a: "Only the row order. Field values, quoting, and the delimiter are re-serialised exactly as parsed.",
