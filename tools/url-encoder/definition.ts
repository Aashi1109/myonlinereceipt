    howToUse: [
      "Leave the toggle on when you are encoding one value that will be dropped into a query string or a path segment — that is the common case.",
      "Turn it off only when the input is already a complete URL and you want its structural characters left alone.",
      "Encode, then paste the result into the URL. Do not encode an already-encoded value: `%20` would become `%2520`.",
      "Non-ASCII text is encoded as UTF-8 percent triplets, which is what servers expect.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Component mode does not escape `!`, `'`, `(`, `)`, or `*`, which are legal in a URL but are sometimes rejected by strict OAuth 1.0 and RFC 3986 implementations. Encode those by hand if a signature check fails.",
      "Whole-URL mode leaves `?`, `&`, `=`, `#`, `/`, and `:` untouched, so it cannot make an arbitrary value safe — it only fixes spaces and non-ASCII characters in a URL that is otherwise already well-formed.",
      "The input is not validated as a URL. Junk in, percent-encoded junk out.",
      "This does not encode `+` as a space. Form-style `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` encoding is a different scheme.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Which mode do I want?",
        a: "Component, almost always. Switch it off only when you are encoding an entire URL as one string.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why is my space `%20` and not `+`?",
        a: "`%20` is the URL percent-encoding of a space. `+` is the form-encoding convention and applies only to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` bodies.",
