      "Type or paste a HEX value with or without the leading `#`. Shorthand (`#f0c`) and alpha (`#RRGGBBAA`) both work.",
      "The `hsl()` string updates as you type and is ready to paste straight into CSS.",
      "Once you are in HSL, build a palette by changing one channel at a time — same hue with different lightness gives you a tint and shade ramp.",
      "A HEX with an alpha channel produces `hsla()` with the alpha as the fourth value.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Hue, saturation, and lightness are rounded to whole numbers, so a round trip back to HEX can land one step off the original.",
      "Only HEX input is accepted — no `rgb()`, no colour names, no `hsl()`.",
      "The `hsl()` format uses legacy comma-separated `hsl(H, S%, L%)` syntax, not the modern space-separated form.",
      "HSL lightness is not perceived brightness. Do not use it to judge contrast; use a contrast checker against WCAG thresholds.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Why use HSL at all?",
        a: "It makes colour relationships obvious. Holding hue and saturation fixed while varying lightness gives a coherent tint and shade ramp, which is fiddly to do in HEX.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why did my colour shift slightly after converting back?",
        a: "Rounding. The HSL channels are whole numbers, so some HEX values have no exact HSL representation.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is transparency supported?",
        a: "Yes. By default, an 8-digit or 4-digit HEX produces `hsla()` with the alpha preserved. Turn off Include alpha to omit it.",
      },
