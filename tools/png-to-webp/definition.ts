      "Add one or more PNG files. Everything is decoded and re-encoded in your browser, so the images never leave the device.",
      "Pick a quality. Screenshots, logos, and anything with sharp text hold up better at 90 or above; photographs saved as PNG are fine at 80.",
      "Run the conversion and download the WebP files. Transparency is carried across, so a PNG with an alpha channel stays transparent.",
      "Use this to shrink PNG assets for the web: a transparent WebP is usually a fraction of the size of the equivalent PNG.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "The WebP is encoded lossily, so a PNG that was a pixel-exact master stops being one. Keep the PNG if you need a lossless source to edit.",
      "Flat colour and hard edges are where lossy encoding shows first. If a converted logo or screenshot looks smeared, raise the quality.",
      "Metadata is not carried over. Decoding to raw pixels drops EXIF, GPS, and colour-profile data.",
      "Each image must be 25 MiB or smaller, up to 50 files per run, and no more than 100 megapixels once decoded.",
    ],
    faq: [
      {
        q: "Is transparency preserved?",
        a: "Yes. WebP has an alpha channel, so transparent and semi-transparent pixels survive the conversion unchanged in position and coverage.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I get a lossless WebP instead?",
        a: "Not from this tool — the encoder here always runs in lossy mode. Setting quality to 100 gets close but is not bit-exact with the source PNG.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why did my file get bigger?",
        a: "PNG already compresses tiny images and flat two-colour graphics extremely well. When the source is that small, WebP's container overhead can win.",
