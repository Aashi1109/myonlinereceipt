    howToUse: [
      "Paste the Base64 string. Standard and URL-safe alphabets both work, and missing `=` padding is added for you.",
      "Whitespace and line breaks inside the value are ignored, so a wrapped PEM-style block or a value copied across several lines decodes fine.",
      "Decode, then copy text or preview and download the decoded file.",
    ],
    limitations: [
      "Recognized PNG, JPEG, and WebP images are previewed. Other binary payloads are downloaded as `decoded.bin`.",
      "Base64 data URIs are accepted directly; the encoded body is extracted automatically.",
      "A JWT is three Base64url segments joined by dots. Paste one segment, or use the JWT Decoder for the whole token.",
      "Invalid characters or a length that cannot be padded to a multiple of four are rejected with 'Base64 input is invalid.'",
