/**
 * Suite and company navigation only — no tool is named here.
 *
 * The footer renders inside client trees (`components/UniversalWorkbench.tsx`,
 * `app/paperwork/components/App.tsx`), so it cannot await the DB-backed
 * `getTools`. A "Popular tools" column therefore has to arrive as data, and
 * `FEATURED_TOOL_IDS` (`lib/tool-framework/categories.ts`) is where that data
 * lands. It is deliberately empty today, so the column simply does not render
 * — the same treatment the devtools catalogue page gives its featured section.
