/**
 * The single text-input trust boundary, shared by every execution host.
 *
 * This replaces the shared preamble guard that used to live in
 * `components/UtilityToolPrimitives.tsx` (which checked both input channels
 * against `MAX_JSON_INPUT_CHARS` before dispatching). That file is deleted by
 * this migration, so without this module the bound would silently disappear
 * for every tool — a spec could declare `maxLength` and nothing would enforce
 * it.
 *
 * It is spec-driven and names no tool: the limit comes from the tool's own
 * `input` declaration, with a framework-wide ceiling as the backstop for
 * specs that declare nothing.
